# Python-Mini-Coin-Counter-Aruco-Detector-Image-Unwarper
A small Python Program which uses OpenCV, PIL and Tkinter to unwarp an image, detect the coins in it, tries too gauge their values and detects an aruco marker. The program was created in July 2023 as part of university coursework. Feel free to play around with the different settings constants.
